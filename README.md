Hello, I´m Philipp✌️

I´m a Machine Learning Engineer located in Hamburg, Germany.

I currently teach ML Engineering and Data Science at NeueFische. Before I was working as ML-Engineer at FreeNow, Enfore, and Otto. I have a background in computer science and sociology and really enjoy combining both points of view in the field of data science but also in daily life.

I like to build machine learning solutions especially with Python, using frameworks like FastAPI, sklearn, and friends, but also enjoy working with languages like Scala and distributed systems like Kafka a lot. More recently I also spend quite some time diving deeper into infrastructure and platform topics in regard to monitoring, alerting, and orchestration in the field of machine learning.
